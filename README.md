Introduction
------------

NVIDIA NeMo is a conversational AI toolkit built for researchers working on automatic speech recognition (ASR),
text-to-speech synthesis (TTS), large language models (LLMs), and
natural language processing (NLP).
The primary objective of NeMo is to help researchers from industry and academia to reuse prior work (code and pretrained models)
and make it easier to create new `conversational AI models <https://developer.nvidia.com/conversational-ai#started>`_.

Getting started with NeMo
------------
State of the Art pretrained NeMo models are freely available on `HuggingFace Hub <https://huggingface.co/models?library=nemo&sort=downloads&search=nvidia>`_ and
`NVIDIA NGC <https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/models?query=nemo&orderBy=weightPopularDESC>`_.
These models can be used to transcribe audio, synthesize speech, or translate text in just a few lines of code.

They have extensive `tutorials <https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/nemo/user-guide/docs/en/stable/starthere/tutorials.html>`_ that
can be run on `Google Colab <https://colab.research.google.com>`_.
